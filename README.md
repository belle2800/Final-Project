Hello!! My name is Belinda Rivera Molina, I am 18 years old student in a AP Computer science class. This is not my first time learning to code. Being a senior, I decided to take this class to explore more into the computer science world and like to maybe continue in college to learning more about it. This portfolio would showcase all of my projects I worked on over the course of the year and see how much I learned and the growth I have made in my code.

## Project Overview

This portfolio represents the mutiple projects of what I have learned throughout the year in my computer science class. It shows my ability to create creative, interactive with web pages using new technology. Within my coding, I improved my creativity skills, learned to organize projects , and was able to learn from my mistakes.

## Portfolio Website Features

My portfolio site includes:

- **Password Generator**  
  We did this as a class and was one of the beginning projects. It allow us for users to create a strog password and make it custimizable based on the criteria.
