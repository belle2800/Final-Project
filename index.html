				<p> Hello!! My name is Belinda Rivera Molina, I am 18 years old student in a AP Computer sciece class. This is not my first time learning to code. Being a senior, I decided to take this class to explore more into the computer science world and like to maybe continue in college to learning more about it. This portfolio would showcase all of my projects I worked on over the course of the year and see how much I learned and the growth I have made in my code.</p>
